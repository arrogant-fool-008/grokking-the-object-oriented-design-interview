## Why This Matters for Interviews

In system design interviews, understanding Object-Oriented Design principles and UML diagrams is essential because:

1. **Clarity of Communication**: UML diagrams help communicate your design clearly to interviewers
2. **Structured Thinking**: OOD principles demonstrate your ability to structure complex systems
3. **Design Validation**: UML helps validate your design before implementation
4. **Industry Standard**: These techniques are widely used in the software industry

!!! tip "Interview Tip"
When discussing your design in an interview, start with a high-level overview using a UML diagram before diving into implementation details.
