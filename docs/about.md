# About This Project

## Origin of the Content

This website is based on the "Grokking the Object Oriented Design Interview" course from [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-object-oriented-design-interview), enhanced with additional code examples and improved navigation.

The original repository contains:

1. **Object-Oriented Design and UML**: Theoretical foundation materials
2. **Object-Oriented Design Case Studies**: 16 practical system design examples
3. **Example codes**: Python implementation examples for each system
4. **Media files**: Diagrams, UML charts, and visual assets

## Technology Used

This website is built using:

- **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**: A fast, simple static site generator
- **[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)**: A beautiful theme with enhanced features
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: All code examples are implemented in Python

## How to Use This Resource

1. **Learn Systematically**: Start with the OOP fundamentals and UML section before diving into case studies
2. **Practice Actively**: Try to design the systems yourself before looking at the provided solutions
3. **Study the Code**: Examine the Python implementations to understand how the designs translate to code
4. **Apply the Methodology**: Use the same systematic approach for your own interview preparation
