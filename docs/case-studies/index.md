# Object-Oriented Design Case Studies

This section contains 16 comprehensive case studies that demonstrate how to apply object-oriented design principles to real-world systems.

## How to Use These Case Studies

Each case study follows a consistent approach:

1. **System Requirements**: Clear specifications of what the system should do
2. **Use Case Diagrams**: Visual representation of system actors and their interactions
3. **Class Diagrams**: Detailed structure of classes, attributes, and relationships
4. **Activity Diagrams**: Flow of activities in key operations
5. **Code Implementation**: Python examples demonstrating the design

## Approach to Solving OOD Problems

When tackling these case studies, follow this systematic approach:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Understand what the system needs to do
2. **Identify Key Objects**: Determine the major entities in the system
3. **Establish Relationships**: Define how objects interact with each other
4. **Design Interfaces**: Define methods and properties for each class
5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about error conditions and special scenarios
6. **Implement Core Components**: Write code for the essential functionality

!!! note "Real-World Application"
These case studies are simplified for learning purposes. Real-world systems would include additional considerations like persistence, security, and scalability.
